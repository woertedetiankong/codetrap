# codetrap Context

codetrap records coding pitfalls as reusable "traps" so an AI coding agent can search known mistakes before writing or changing code.

## Domain Vocabulary

### Trap

A trap is one recorded mistake pattern. It has:

- `title`: short human-readable summary.
- `category`: one of the categories in `src/lib/constants.ts`.
- `scope`: `project` or `global`.
- `context`: when the mistake tends to happen.
- `mistake`: what the AI or developer tends to do wrong.
- `fix`: the preferred correction.
- `tags`: JSON-encoded string in SQLite, exposed as a string array on input.
- `before_code` / `after_code`: optional examples.
- `severity`: `warning`, `error`, or `critical`.
- `hit_count`: incremented when a trap is shown through the CLI.

The canonical TypeScript definitions and schema metadata live in `src/domain/trap.ts`.

### Scope

codetrap stores traps in two scopes:

- `project`: traps for the nearest ancestor directory containing `.codetrap/`.
- `global`: traps shared across all projects in `~/.codetrap/`.

Project scope is resolved from the current working directory by walking upward until `.codetrap/` is found. If no project root exists, project-scoped writes fail and callers should either run `codetrap init` or use `global`.

### Storage

Each scope has its own SQLite database named `traps.db`.

- Project database: `<project-root>/.codetrap/traps.db`
- Global database: `~/.codetrap/traps.db`

The schema is initialized automatically when a database connection is opened. The schema includes an FTS5 virtual table and triggers that keep the full-text index synchronized with the `traps` table.

### Search

Full-text search uses SQLite FTS5 over `title`, `context`, `mistake`, `fix`, and `tags`.

By default, search checks project scope first when a project exists, then global scope. Callers may pass `scope` to restrict search to one database and `category` to filter results.

Chinese search is a known future improvement: default FTS5 tokenization is not enough for good Chinese word segmentation.

## Adapter Rules

### CLI

The CLI is optimized for direct terminal use.

- `show <id>` increments the shown trap's `hit_count` in the scope where it was found.
- `search` and `list` render human-readable trap summaries.
- `add` and `edit` currently accept structured `--json` input.

### MCP Server

The MCP server is optimized for AI tool use.

- Tools return JSON text payloads.
- `search_traps` searches both scopes by default, unless `scope` is provided.
- MCP `get_trap` does not increment `hit_count`; the counter currently reflects CLI `show` usage.
- `TrapStore.hit(id)` follows the same project-first fallback as `get(id)` when no scope is provided. Passing an explicit scope restricts the hit update to that scope.

## Design Direction

Keep domain concepts centralized and adapters thin:

- Domain definitions belong in `src/domain/`.
- `TrapRepository` in `src/db/repository.ts` owns single-database trap operations.
- `TrapStore` owns project/global scope policy and composes repositories.
- CLI and MCP should share execution logic where possible, then render results differently.
- Future search changes should be isolated behind the search/query layer so ICU, jieba, or vector search can be added without rewriting adapters.

For tests, use `openDatabase(":memory:")` from `src/db/connection.ts` and pass the database to `new TrapRepository(db)`. This initializes schema without touching project or global files.
